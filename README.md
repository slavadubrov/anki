# German to English Translation and Anki Card Generator

## Overview

This project is designed to generate English translations and example sentences from German text inputs and automatically create Anki cards for language learning. The primary use case is for students or enthusiasts learning German who want to build a customized vocabulary deck in Anki with accurate translations and context-rich example sentences.

## Project Structure

- **`anki/`**: Main directory containing the modules for handling German vocabulary and interfacing with Anki.
  - **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the `anki` module.
  - **`constants.py`**: Contains constants used throughout the project.
  - **`german_deck_db.py`**: Module for managing the German deck database.
  - **`german_deck.py`**: Contains the `GermanDeck` class, responsible for adding notes and managing the Anki deck.
  - **`german_model.py`**: Defines the model for German vocabulary Anki cards.
  - **`response_schema.py`**: Defines the schema for responses from the LLM.
  - **`templates.py`**: Contains templates for extracting and formatting data from the LLM.

- **`data/`**: Directory containing data used or generated by the project.
  - **`Data.csv`**: A CSV file potentially used as input data.
  - **`german_vocabulary.apkg`**: The generated Anki package containing the vocabulary deck.
  - **`german_vocabulary.db`**: The database file storing German vocabulary.
  - **`OutdoorClothingCatalog_1000.csv`**: An additional CSV file, possibly related to a different dataset.

- **`notebooks/`**: Directory containing Jupyter Notebooks for various stages of the project.
  - **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the `notebooks` module.
  - **`0-anki.ipynb`**: Notebook for Anki deck management.
  - **`1-openai.ipynb`**: Notebook for interacting with OpenAI's GPT models.
  - **`2-openai+anki+preprocess.ipynb`**: Main notebook that integrates OpenAI's models with Anki for processing and card creation.

- **`venv/`**: Virtual environment directory (usually created when setting up a Python virtual environment).

- **`.env`**: Environment file containing sensitive configurations such as API keys.

- **`.flake8`**: Configuration file for linting Python code with Flake8.

- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore in a Git repository.

- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Configuration file for pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before committing.

- **`Dockerfile`**: Docker configuration file for containerizing the application.

- **`LICENSE`**: The projectâ€™s license file.

- **`makefile`**: Contains commands for setting up and managing the project.

- **`pytest.ini`**: Configuration file for Pytest, which is used for running tests.

- **`README.md`**: The file you're currently reading, which explains the project.

- **`requirements-test.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies needed for testing the project.

- **`requirements.lock`**: Lock file for ensuring consistent dependency installations.

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies needed to run the project.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
make install
```

## Usage

Place the German words or phrases you want to translate and generate Anki cards for in the `txt_input` variable within the `2-openai+anki+preprocess.ipynb` notebook. The input should be a multiline string, with each German term on a new line.

Open the notebook and execute the cells sequentially to generate and save the Anki cards.

## Development

To set up the development environment:

```bash
make install
```

To run tests:

```bash
make test
```

To lint and format the code:

```bash
make lint
make format
```
